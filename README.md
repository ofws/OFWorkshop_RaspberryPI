[Raspberry Pi + OF workshop Note](https://sfpc.hackpad.com/Raspberry-Pi-OpenFrameworks-HGi1I8lv4s9)


**osc_skeleton**

This application is the base of all the others. It does nothing more than set up the basics for broadcasting and receiving osc messages.

**osc_audio_example**

This one builds on the osc_skeleton, adding an audio play that reacts to mouse/moved and mouse/pressed messages from other clients on the network.

**osc_video_example**

Here we give a simple example of modifying camera input data using osc messages.

**osc_graphics_example**

In this example, we use the mouse/moved message and draw the remote mice locations on our own screen.

**osc_chatroom_example**

A slightly more advanced example, this one builds a basic chatroom that will display chat messages sent from all other clients on the network. NOTE: this one doesn't currently work on the Pi due to it's dependency on ofxUI addon.
